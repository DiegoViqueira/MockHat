  "task_answer": "Hi my dearest friend, I’m excited about that as you. Of course I can go. I don’t prefer to listen only one genre of music for too long, so, if concert will annoy me, I will go, I suppose you don’t mind. You know, I don’t depend on kinds of music, I listen what I like to, but still, I don’t mind about rock. We can go for climbing for sure, but If you’re meaning climbing by ropes and pickaxes, I’m out. I’m afraid of heights. If you have something on your mind please offer me. I’m looking forward for next week. Alex",

There are some negative comments, so, if concert will annoy me, I will go, which could be expressed in a more polite way, but the general ideas are communicated."

      "feedback": "Everyday vocabulary is used generally appropriately, genre; annoy; don’t mind; pickaxes; afraid of heights, although there is some lifting from the input text, excited about that; I don’t prefer. Simple grammatical forms are used with some degree of control, including attempts at forming conditional clauses, if concert will annoy me, I will go; If you’re meaning … I’m out; If you have something on your mind, please offer me. There are a number of errors with prepositions and word choices, I don’t depend on kinds of music; for climbing; please offer me, which leads to a lack of clarity at times. For example, I will go is ambiguous as it could mean I will leave the concert or I will go to the concert, so meaning is unclear at times."
