  "assigned_task": "You have just received an email from your English-speaking friend, Jo.\nFrom: Jo\nHi,\nYou know I’ve joined my local swimming team – well, I love it! We train every Tuesday and Thursday after school. Now my parents want me to go to an extra maths class on Tuesdays, so I won’t be able to swim then.\nHow do you think I can persuade them to change their minds?\nWrite soon,\nJo\nWrite your email.",
  "task_answer": "Hi Jo,\nIt is good to receive news from you! I bet you are swimming like a fish. Do you remember when we were kids and we made a few races in Angelina’s pool?\nI understand why you are trying to persuade them but remember that they want your best. If I were you, firstly I would try to talk with your swimming coach and ask him about the possibilities of training another day. Then if the answer is negative, I would try to do the same with your future math teacher. I am sure that everyone knows the importance of practising sports while studying, so they will find a solution.\nIf everything doesn’t happen as you and I expect, ensure that your parents don’t get mad with your decision. They are giving their best! Put your education in first place. Opportunities to swim you will have a lot during your life. Moreover, you can come to Barcelona and try to catch me in the pool.\nGood luck,\nSam",

A range of simple and some complex grammatical forms has been used with a good degree of control: I understand … best; If I were you … another day; I am sure … solution; If everything … decision; Opportunities … your life. The errors do not impede communication: if the answer would have been negative I will try; yours; Opportunities to swim you will have."
