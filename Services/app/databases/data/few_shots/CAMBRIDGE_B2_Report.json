  "assigned_task": "A group of British teachers is going to visit your college for two days. The aim of their trip is to learn about how technology is used in education in your country. You have been asked to write a report for the group leader. Your report should: Include information about how technology is used to teach different subjects. Recommend which lessons the teachers should watch to see technology being used. Write your report.",
  "task_answer": "Use of Technology in education Introduction This report is intended to inform how technology is used in common lessons and recommend the most interesting technical developments to be seen. I conducted a survey among teachers and students in order to find out what is preferred to be used by them. Technology in different subjects The majority of the people claimed that the best thing were computers and interactive boards. I was given these reasons: They provide an opportunity to make the lessons more enjoyable. Everybody is able to find information on the internet whenever they want to. Computer presentations can be easily given. However, use of another technical developments vary among students and teachers depending on which subject they focus on. For instance, people who were interested in Science mentioned these points: Newly equipped chemical lab with its recently purchased substances. Equipment suitable for teaching Physics (e.g. digital watches, laser). Recommendations For most of the people who I asked for their reply were really important computers and interactive boards in the classrooms. I would therefore recommend seeing this. On the other hand, if you are interested in particular subjects you ought to see their specialised classrooms with a variety of modern technical developments, too.",

The report gives information about which technology is used for teaching purposes around the school (interactive boards; computers) and specifically in science (newly equipped chemical lab). The report has a clear recommendation at the end and gives options about what would be good for the reader to see: either going to see what the students have decided is important (computers and interactive boards) or what the reader has a specific interest in (if you are interested in particular subjects you ought to see their specialised classrooms)."

A range of simple and some more complex grammatical forms is used, particularly different passive structures. Some errors occur when attempting more complex ideas (For most of the people who I asked for their reply were really important computers). However, the errors do not impede communication."
