The narrative describes Tom’s emotions (He was shocked; He was a little bit angry) and tells the story through a sequence of events.The target reader’s attention is not always held because some of the sentences are quite short and this interrupts the narrative flow of the story (He this adress. It was Oxford Street 42. He knocked the door)."

The story has a beginning, a middle and an end and there are events which take place in sequence.Basic linking words and a limited number of cohesive devices, mainly time references, (1 hour later; finally; but next day) are used to connect sentences and move the story forward."

There is a range of grammatical forms, past and present tenses, generally used with a good degree of control. Sentence structures are mostly simple and quite short. Errors do not impede communication."
