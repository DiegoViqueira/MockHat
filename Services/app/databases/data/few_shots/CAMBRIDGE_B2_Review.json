The candidate introduces the topic of the book and the subject matter in an engaging way, using a rhetorical question, then summarises some of the events in the narrative (In the book; it is told that; One day, the king; later on). Straightforward ideas are communicated. Information is given about some of the characters and main events, and the writer concludes with their opinions of the book (This book is suitable for; I can say that; High recommended as …)."

      "criteria": "Organisation",
      "score": 3.0,
      "feedback": "The text is generally well organised and coherent. It moves from general information in the introduction, to more specific details about the story in the next two paragraphs, and concludes with an appropriate summary and opinion about the book. A variety of linking words and cohesive devices are used in the text, including reference pronouns (it didn’t work that way for little Gautama; he; him; One day; and; there; later on; This book)."

    {
      "criteria": "Language",
      "score": 3.0,
      "feedback": "A range of everyday vocabulary is used appropriately, and although there are some errors (fasilities; all senses’ gratification stuff) there is also some good use of less common lexis (started his spiritual journey). Both simple and more complex grammatical forms are used with a good degree of control (What would you do if you were born; who in the future would be a Buddah; before going to bed). Errors do not impede communication."
