Everything was made of gold including palms and stones on the island. He wanted to take some stones with him to be rich but as he got one of them the stones started getting gray. Lou got nervous and he decided to put the stone on the beach again. The stones turned to gold. Then he entered deeper to the beach. He saw some golden fruits, but he didn’t picked because he knew the result. He took some photos of the beach and showed them to the scientists after he arrived home. He became an explorer. Lou became rich and after that he had a beautiful life.",
