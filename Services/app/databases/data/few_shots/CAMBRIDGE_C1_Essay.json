  "task_answer": "It is clear for everyone that this century is the era of mass media. There are plenty of supporters of the theory of media being „the forth power“. But we should discuss the role of a journalist in this world of information. First of all, the main purpose of journalism is to provide a society with the news. Mass media is able to connect main social institutions, that is why without the news our society is not able to function. But at the same time we should look after the quality of information : it should be reliable, trust–worthy and presented in a neutral way. Nowadays at the golden age of tabloids, when this principle seems to be forgotten we need to bring back to life the image of an honest journalist who is a servant of society. Though today journalism is seen as an evil instrument of manipulation it has not always been like that. At the begining of the twentyeh century there was the start of the investigative journalism. The correspondents tried to change the world, fighting against illegal or immoral actions of a government. With the help of these brave soldiers of pen there were numerous cases when social catastrophies were prevented. To sum up I would like to say that there is much more behind journalism than simply telling the news. In my opinion journalists should inspire people to change the society for the better.",
