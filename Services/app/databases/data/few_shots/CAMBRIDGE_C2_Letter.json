  "assigned_task": "A lifestyle magazine has asked readers for their views about the quality of life in today's towns and cities. You decide to write a letter in which you briefly describe one or two personal experiences that illustrate what urban life is like for you and other people in your neighbourhood. You should also explain which factors are crucial for a good quality of life in towns and cities generally, and why. Write your letter. Do not add any postal addresses.",
  "task_answer": "Dear Life and Style magazine,\n\nI am writing in response to your monthly topic, this one being 'A Good Life', to share my view about the quality of life in Dublin, where I live.\n\nDublin possesses two strong points that make it stand out as one of the cities with the best quality of life in Europe: the pace of life and a sense of community.\n\nFirstly, the pace of life in Dublin is considered to be stress-free. Despite the often foul weather, Dubliners look relaxed and never in a hurry even when going to work. After work, they would normally share a few pints with colleagues before heading home, and all this without a scowl on their faces. Secondly, there is an omnipresent sense of community. For example, in my neighbourhood Smithfield, every Sunday a market and fair is held at Smithfield Square where families and friends get together to eat or to see the live shows, and where it is quite normal to share a laugh with a stranger. Tourists often point out that Dubliners and Irish alike are welcoming people who would come to your aid when in need.\n\nIn my opinion, both a tranquil pace of life and a solid sense of community are crucial to enhance the quality of life of any town or city. Both have an impact on the perception of a place and affect the atmosphere either positively or negatively. An example of a city with a poor quality of life, which lacks the two factors mentioned above, would be my birthplace Buenos Aires, Argentina. People in the streets are constantly stressed due to work, traffic or other issues; they walk hurriedly and tend to push others out of their way. Additionally, because of high crime rates, citizens are normally wary of strangers and would never stop to help others due to paranoia.",
