  "task_answer": "After the event I organised with the other school representatives, in order to raise funds for charity, it can be said that it was a success. This even made a really good image for the school, even because most of the students came. The event took place last saturday afternoon, and every member of the school was invited with the family and friends who desires to participate. Being close to the Christmas period we invited people to bring clothes, toys, books and everything they would like to donate to less fortunate people. All those things were then given to a charity association that help people of the city and even of other countries such as Romania and Brazil. Beyond of this we even sold creative christmas object that two classes made during a workshop in the last month. For entertaining everybody with something useful two associations came to present themselves and their activities. After this people were free to make offers and the amazing thing is that most of the participants donated something. This day shoud to be considered a real success because of the high number of people who came, which is around five hundreds. The positive thing is that everybody participated actively and happily in a way I have rarely seen. Many objects and moneys were donated and this improved the life of many people with little effort. Concluding I suggest to do this event every year around the Christmas period because is a way of doing something positive in an easy and happy way. Not only because many people came, but also because we helped many unlike families.",
