### **INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH (IP) (2.5 marks)**

- **2.5 marks:** The IP introduces the topic clearly, grabs the reader’s attention, and does not include the writer’s opinion.
- **1 mark:** The IP does not clearly advance the rest of the essay, is unclear or misleading, and/or includes the writer’s opinion.
- **0 marks:** There is no IP establishing the topic. Instead, the writer jumps directly into argumentation.

### **SUPPORTING PARAGRAPHS (SP) (5 marks)**

The body of the essay: SPs develop the IP with facts, details, and/or examples. All SPs must relate to the IP (i.e., no irrelevant facts, details, or examples).

- **5 marks:** Between two and four fully developed SPs covering both sides of the argument, or two fully developed paragraphs, one on each side, with relevant facts, details, and/or examples. The relationships among SPs and with the IP are clearly established with connecting words.

- **2 marks:** More than four SPs, but they are not sufficiently developed. No attempt to establish relationships among SPs or with the IP.
