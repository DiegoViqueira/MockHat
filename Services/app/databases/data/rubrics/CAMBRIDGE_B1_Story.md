## Assessment

### Assessment scales

Tasks are marked using assessment scales that were developed with explicit reference to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). The scales consist of four subscales: Content, Communicative Achievement, Organisation, and Language:

- **Content** focuses on how well the candidate has fulfilled the task, in other words if they have done what they were asked to do.
- **Communicative Achievement** focuses on how appropriate the writing is for the task and whether the candidate has used the appropriate register.
- **Organisation** focuses on the way the candidate puts together the piece of writing, in other words if it is logical and ordered.
- **Language** focuses on vocabulary and grammar. This includes the range of language as well as how accurate it is.

Responses are marked on each subscale from 0 to 5.

When the tasks are being marked, the length of responses and varieties of English are taken into account:

- Guidelines on length are provided for each task; responses which are too short may not have an adequate range of language and may not provide all the information that is required, while responses which are too long may contain irrelevant content and have a negative effect on the reader. These may affect candidates’ marks on the relevant subscales.
- Candidates are expected to use a particular variety of English with some degree of consistency in areas such as spelling, and not, for example, switch from using a British spelling of a word to an American spelling of the same word.
- Candidates should also aim to use a range of tenses, expressions, and vocabulary, even if these contain some minor mistakes. It’s important for candidates to show the full range of their language ability and to be ambitious in their use of language.
- Non-impeding errors, which do not affect communication, will not necessarily be penalised. These include spelling, grammar or punctuation errors. However, errors which interfere with or cause a breakdown in communication will be treated more severely.

### The subscale Content is common to all levels:

#### CONTENT

**5**

- All content is relevant to the task.
- Target reader is fully informed.

**3**

- Minor irrelevances and/or omissions may be present.
- Target reader is on the whole informed.

**1**

- Irrelevances and misinterpretation of task may be present.
- Target reader is minimally informed.

**0**

- Content is totally irrelevant.
- Target reader is not informed.

### The remaining three subscales (Communicative Achievement, Organisation, and Language) have descriptors specific to each CEFR level:

| CEFR LEVEL | COMMUNICATIVE ACHIEVEMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ORGANISATION                                                                                                                                | LANGUAGE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Writing Mark Scheme

### Glossary of Terms

#### 1. General

- **Generally** refers to performance that is not as good as ‘appropriately’.
- **Flexibility** refers to the ability to adapt language, organisational devices, or task conventions, rather than using the same form over and over, evidencing better control and a wider repertoire.

#### 2. Content

- **Relevant** means related or relatable to required content points and/or task requirements.
- **Target reader** is the hypothetical reader set up in the task (e.g., a magazine’s readership, your English teacher).
- **Informed** means content points and/or task requirements are addressed and appropriately developed.

#### 3. Communicative Achievement

- **Conventions of the communicative task** include genre, format, register, and function.
- **Holding the target reader’s attention** refers to quality that allows a reader to derive meaning and not be distracted.
- **Communicative purpose** refers to the communicative requirements set out in the task.
- **Straightforward and complex ideas**: Straightforward ideas are limited and concrete, requiring simpler rhetorical devices. Complex ideas are abstract and require more rhetorical resources.

#### 4. Organisation

- **Linking words** refer to basic high-frequency vocabulary that provides explicit linkage.
- **Cohesive devices** include linking words, reference pronouns, substitution, ellipsis, or repetition.
- **Organisational patterns** refer to less-explicit ways of achieving connection between sentences and beyond.

#### 5. Language

- **Vocabulary**:
  - **Basic vocabulary**: Used for survival purposes and simple transactions.
  - **Everyday vocabulary**: Common vocabulary in non-technical situations.
  - **Less common lexis**: Vocabulary items that are used less frequently but enhance clarity.
- **Appropriacy of vocabulary**: The use of words and phrases that fit the context.
- **Grammatical forms**:
  - **Simple grammatical forms**: Words, phrases, basic tenses, simple clauses.
  - **Complex grammatical forms**: Noun clauses, relative and adverb clauses, subordination, passive forms, modal forms.
- **Grammatical control**: The ability to use grammar accurately and appropriately.
- **Range**: The variety of words and grammatical forms a candidate uses.
- **Errors and slips**:
  - **Errors**: Systematic mistakes.
  - **Slips**: Non-systematic mistakes due to momentary lapse.
- **Impede communication**: When meaning is unclear or difficult to determine.
