## Assessment

### Assessment Scales

Tasks are marked using assessment scales that were developed with explicit reference to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). The scales consist of four subscales: **Content, Communicative Achievement, Organisation, and Language**:

- **Content** focuses on how well the candidate has fulfilled the task, in other words, if they have done what they were asked to do.
- **Communicative Achievement** focuses on how appropriate the writing is for the task and whether the candidate has used the appropriate register.
- **Organisation** focuses on the way the candidate puts together the piece of writing, in other words, if it is logical and ordered.
- **Language** focuses on vocabulary and grammar. This includes the range of language as well as how accurate it is.

Responses are marked on each subscale from 0 to 5.

When being marked, the length of responses and varieties of English are taken into account:

- Guidelines on length are provided for each task; responses which are too short may not have an adequate range of language and may not provide all the information that is required, while responses which are too long may contain irrelevant content and have a negative effect on the reader. These may affect candidates’ marks on the relevant subscales.
- Candidates are expected to use a particular variety of English with some degree of consistency in areas such as spelling, and not, for example, switch from using a British spelling of a word to an American spelling of the same word.

### The subscale Content is common to all levels:

#### CONTENT

**5**

- All content is relevant to the task.
- Target reader is fully informed.

**3**

- Minor irrelevances and/or omissions may be present.
- Target reader is on the whole informed.

**1**

- Irrelevances and misinterpretation of task may be present.
- Target reader is minimally informed.

**0**

- Content is totally irrelevant.
- Target reader is not informed.

### The remaining three subscales (Communicative Achievement, Organisation, and Language) have descriptors specific to each CEFR level:

| CEFR LEVEL | COMMUNICATIVE ACHIEVEMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ORGANISATION                                                                                                                                | LANGUAGE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Writing Mark Scheme

### Glossary of Terms

#### 1. General

- **Generally** refers to performance that is not as good as ‘appropriately’.
- **Flexibility** refers to the ability to adapt language, organisational devices, or task conventions, rather than using the same form over and over, evidencing better control and a wider repertoire.

#### 2. Content

- **Relevant** means related or relatable to required content points and/or task requirements.
- **Target reader** is the hypothetical reader set up in the task (e.g., a magazine’s readership, your English teacher).
- **Informed** means content points and/or task requirements are addressed and appropriately developed. Some content points do not require much development (e.g., state what is X), while others require it (e.g., describe, explain).

#### 3. Communicative Achievement

- **Conventions of the communicative task** include genre, format, register, and function.
- **Holding the target reader’s attention** refers to the quality of a text that allows a reader to derive meaning and not be distracted.
- **Communicative purpose** refers to the communicative requirements set out in the task, e.g., make a complaint, suggest alternatives.

#### 4. Organisation

- **Linking words** refer to basic high-frequency vocabulary that provides explicit linkage.
- **Cohesive devices** include more sophisticated linking words and phrases (e.g., moreover, it may appear, as a result), as well as grammatical devices such as reference pronouns, substitution, ellipsis, or repetition.
- **Organisational patterns** refer to less-explicit ways of achieving connection at the between-sentence level and beyond.

#### 5. Language

- **Vocabulary**:
  - **Basic vocabulary**: Used for survival purposes and simple transactions.
  - **Everyday vocabulary**: Common vocabulary in non-technical situations.
  - **Less common lexis**: Vocabulary items that appear less often in the relevant domain. These items often help to express ideas more succinctly and precisely.
- **Appropriacy of vocabulary**: The use of words and phrases that fit the context of the given task. For example, in _I’m very sensible to noise_, the word _sensible_ is inappropriate as the correct word should be _sensitive_.
- **Grammatical forms**:
  - **Simple grammatical forms**: Words, phrases, basic tenses, and simple clauses.
  - **Complex grammatical forms**: Longer and more complex items, e.g., noun clauses, relative and adverb clauses, subordination, passive forms, infinitives, verb patterns, modal forms, and tense contrasts.
- **Grammatical control**: The ability to consistently use grammar accurately and appropriately to convey intended meaning.
- **Range**: The variety of words and grammatical forms a candidate uses. At higher levels, candidates will make increasing use of a greater variety of words, fixed phrases, collocations, and grammatical forms.
- **Errors and slips**:
  - **Errors**: Systematic mistakes.
  - **Slips**: Non-systematic mistakes due to momentary lapse.
- **Impede communication**: When meaning is unclear or difficult to determine.
