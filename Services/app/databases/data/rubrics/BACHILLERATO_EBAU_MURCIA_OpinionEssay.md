## **CONTENT RELEVANCE & ESSAY ORGANIZATION (15 marks)**

Evaluates what is said and whether it is said where it corresponds in the essay.

### **CONTENT RELEVANCE (CR) (5 marks)**

Assesses how the subject matter of the answer relates to the writing prompt.

- **5 marks:** Full understanding of the specific content requirements.
- **2.5 marks:** Partial understanding of the specific content requirements.
- **0 marks:** No understanding of the specific content requirements.

### **INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH (IP) (2.5 marks)**

The IP clearly establishes the point of the essay and provides the writer’s opinion.

- **2.5 marks:** The IP introduces the topic clearly, grabs attention, and invites reading. The writer’s opinion is clearly established.
- **1 mark:** The IP does not clearly advance the rest of the essay, is unclear or misleading, and/or does not include the writer’s opinion.
- **0 marks:** There is no IP. Instead, the writer jumps directly into the opinion.

### **SUPPORTING PARAGRAPHS (SP) (5 marks)**

The body of the essay: SPs develop the IP with facts, details, and/or examples. All SPs must relate to the IP. The relationship between each SP and the IP must be clearly indicated with connecting words. The same applies to the relationship between one SP and the next (or previous) one.

- **5 marks:** There are between two and four fully developed SPs, with relevant facts, details, and/or examples. The relationship between each SP and the IP and other (prior or next) SPs is clearly established with connecting words.
- **3.5 marks:** The SPs are unequally developed. Some are well developed with relevant facts, details, and/or examples, while others resemble neutral statements instead of arguments supporting the writer’s opinion. The writer attempts to establish relationships between SPs and the IP, successfully in some cases and unsuccessfully in others.
- **2 marks:** There are more than two SPs, but they are not sufficiently or clearly developed. No attempt to establish the relationship between the SPs and the IP.
- **0 marks:** The body of the essay consists of one long SP or a series of short and/or disconnected sentences. The SPs do not provide enough facts, details, or examples to develop the IP or seem unrelated. No clear relationship is established between SPs.

### **CLOSING PARAGRAPH (CP) (2.5 marks)**

The CP must restate the writer’s opinion (and, if possible, the main arguments) and include a call to action. The conclusion must contribute to convincing the reader.

- **2.5 marks:** The CP restates the writer’s opinion in a new, more insightful manner and summarizes the main arguments. It includes a call to action and reinforces the writer’s opinion.
- **1 mark:** The CP does not restate the writer’s opinion or repeats it in the same words. It does not summarize the main arguments or include a call to action. Overall, it fails to reinforce the writer’s opinion.
- **0 marks:** There is no CP. The essay ends while still providing arguments in support of the writer’s opinion. No sense of closure.
