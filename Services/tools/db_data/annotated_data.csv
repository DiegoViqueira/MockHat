I just got your email and I think it’s really great idea 
becase I think lots of people like watching films.
I personally would prefer Mondays because on Fridays 
I often have other plans with my family
I would really love to see some detective or some 
action films but I relly do’t mind watching something 
different.
I think it’s good idea to have some food or drink 
during the film because lots of people are used to 
it because in cinemas they always eat something so i 
think it would 
be great
Have a nice day",5,5,4,4,"All content is relevant to the task.
The target reader is fully informed about all the points in the task and 
there is a direct and clear response to each one in turn. 
The candidate covers the first point, I think it’s really great idea, and 
clearly says which day they would prefer and explains why. The candidate 
explains which types of films they would like to see, and gives an opinion 
about providing food and drink during the films.
This script therefore obtains a 5 for content as the content points are 
addressed and appropriately developed.","The conventions of an email are used, with opening and closing 
salutations appropriate for the candidate’s context, and there is also a 
reference to the 
input email at the beginning: I just got your email. The register is consistent 
and appropriate.
The email holds the reader’s attention throughout, and communicates 
straightforward ideas in direct response to the input email. Points are 
expressed and explained very clearly","The email is well organised and always coherent, with a clearly 
demarcated short paragraph for each point. 
There is some use of referencing as a cohesive device: lots of people 
are used to it
; so i think it would be great, and the text flows naturally, 
although there is over-reliance on some linking words, such as because
.","A range of everyday vocabulary appropriate for the topic is used: 
detective or some action films
; I personally would prefer
; other plans with 
my family
.
There is a good degree of control of language: but I relly do’t mind 
watching something different; lots of people are used to it; in cinemas they 
always eat something. There are very few errors and none which impede 
communication.
The candidate could improve their language mark by evidencing more use 
of complex grammatical forms, and more variety in sentence structure. "

Oh, new film club is great idea. It sounds really grait. 
I prefer Friday, because it should be a nice end of the week to watch some films on 
Monday, you have to prepare for the school and watching films, it is for me wasting 
of time when the school week is starting. I really like sci-fi, but I don’t mind any

notes in the input email (Oh, new film club is great idea. It sounds really 
grait; I prefer Friday … starting; I really like sci-fi … bring). The final point 
is also addressed; the reader may have to refer to the original email to 
check what is being referred to, but this is acceptable.

information to develop the points.","The text uses the conventions of an email communication, although it lacks 
any kind of closing salutation or sign-off suitable for the target reader (a 
teacher). 
Straightforward ideas are expressed about the club, which day to hold it 
on, which type of films to show and whether to provide food and drink or 
not.
The tone and register are appropriate throughout and the opening 
salutation may well be suitable in this candidate’s context.","The script is connected and coherent. Basic linking words, such as because, 
but and and are used, together with a limited number of cohesive devices, 
mainly in the form of referencing (it, that).","Everyday vocabulary is generally used appropriately, for example a nice 
end of the week; to prepare for the school; sci-fi; so much time.
Simple grammatical forms are used and some sentences show an attempt, 
not entirely successful, to produce more complex language, e.g. … because 
after we’ll end we must clear a class and I think it can take so much time.
The errors are noticeable, although these frequently arise as a result of 
trying to use more ambitious vocabulary (let it up to you; clear a class) and

incredible day; The teacher at the beggining was mad, but later she 
started so happy and she fun, like everyone.

so happy; she fun; … later have a lot of entertainment; I was fun so much; I

communicated: We went last Saturday to Chiseni; I suggest you to go such 
place.","The text has an overall organisation, with a progression of ideas, although

of supporters of the theory of media being „the forth power“. But we should 
discuss the role of a journalist in this world of information.
First of all, the main purpose of journalism is to provide a society with the news. 
Mass media is able to connect main social institutions, that is why without the 
news our society is not able to function. But at the same time we should look after 
the quality of information : it should be reliable, trust-worthy and presented in a 
neutral way. Nowadays at the golden age of tabloids, when this principle seems to be 
forgotten we need to bring back to life the image of an honest journalist who is a 
servant of society.
Though today journalism is seen as an evil instrument of manipulation it has not 
always been like that. At the beginning of the twentyeth century there was the 
start of the investigative journalism. The correspondents tried to change the 
world, fighting against illegal or immoral actions of a government. With the help of 
these brave soldiers of pen there were numerous cases when social catastrophies 
were prevented.
To sum up I would like to say that there is much more behind journalism than simply 
telling the news. In my opinion journalists should inspire people to change the society 
for the better.",5,3,4,4,"All content is relevant to the task.

the better.","The conventions of essay writing are used effectively. There is a clear development 
of the topic from introduction through to conclusion and the style is consistently 
appropriate, using an objective tone, which holds the reader’s attention throughout.
Straightforward and some more complex ideas, for example when discussing

why; Nowadays, when this principle seems to be forgotten; an honest journalist who 
is a servant of a society; With the help of these brave soldiers of pen; To sum up, and

inversion for emphasis: that is why without the news our society is not able to function;

about the issue or the title and topic seem interesting enough to warrant you to 
read it. Clearly, newspapers or television news are our main source of information in 
our society, which are written or presented by journalists. Journalists are people, as 
we all are, and therefore have an opinion on everything they experience, especially 
when they do research on the topic they are writing about.
The main goal of presenting valuable information to the public is often 
overshadowed by the inability to exclude their own opinion on the matter. Surely, 
the expression of opinion is often desired in some newspapers, but it should not be 
done at the cost that some journalists deliberately exclude important facts on the 
issue or change certain statements.
Naturally, no one can write any kind of text completely void of opinion. Though, it 
is not necessary to push our society via articles or other means towards a singular 
opinion, which can be considered wrong sometimes due to the lack of valuable 
information.

In this Essay I will discuss two of them.
The first point is to provide Information. An Journalists job is it to provide 
Informations as well as facts about a special topic. He has to do it in the way that 
the reader will get no difficulties to understand it and build his own opinion. It 
is also important to write from a neutral point of view to not influence 
the readers opinion. The article should only be about the topic and nothing else 
otherwise the reader could be confused. The Journalist also has to
include all the known facts and Informations to let the reader know everything 
about what he is reading.
The other point I want to talk about is the Journalists influence on the readers 
opinion. A well written article about a Topic shouldn’t change the readers view 
on the subject. Also significant is to give the consumer room to made up his own 
opinion, the writer can do this In the way he writes and with the formulation and construction of his article. Sometimes It is essential that the writer 
gives his own opinion about the topic he is writting and sometimes it is important 
to influence the writers opinion, with facts the reader may not know for example.
From my point of view providing Information is the more Important aspect. 
A reason therefor is that even if the article influences the readers mind about it 
the Journalist provides Informations and that’s the essential point. Another point 
that lets me think this way is that to write about something includes 
giving facts and Informations about it, and that’s why he writes the article and the 
reader reads it.",5,2,2,2,"All content is relevant to the task.

in the first paragraph and the use of an objective, neutral tone, are used effectively 
to hold the target reader’s attention and communicate straightforward ideas. 
There is an attempt to communicate more complex ideas, but this is sometimes 
unsuccessful due to language slips: it is essential that the writer gives his own 
opinion about the topic he is writting and sometimes it is important to influence the 
writers [reader’s] opinion, with facts the reader may not know.","The text is well organised and coherent. There is good structure to the text, which 
develops logically, and a variety of linking words and cohesive devices are used to 
connect the ideas within and across paragraphs: The first point; It is also; otherwise;

which is used appropriately: commonly known aspects; neutral point of view;

degree of control: should only be about; could be confused; can do this In the way he

INTRODUCTION
The principle aim of this report is to provide information about The Chariety Day which took 
place on the last Sunday. It was organized to support The Centre for parentless children in 
Chicago. ^ (CPC)
WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE?
The purpose of the event was to raise money for the CPC. Visitors could try numerous 
activities they might not have a chance to try normally. Activities offered included:
• horseback riding
• curling
• golf
• fencing
and many other.
WHAT WAS SUCCESSFUL?
It made us very happy that all the people who came could find something they liked. Either 
adults accompanying their songs and daughters or children just entering an elementary 
school had a lot of fun. The most favoured activity was definitely curling. Visitors of all ages 
kept coming and purchasing tickets allowing them to participate in the game.
A group of people willing to donate money to the CPC is also hold to be a great success 
since The Charity Day’s aim was to support the CPC as much as possible.
RECOMMENDATIONS
As far as reaching the day’s target is concerned, I must state that the event has 
been the most successful fundraising action at our school this year. However, not everything went 
well during the day. Plans were not thinking about the possibility of rain and when it began to rain

","At first I was doubting a lot about wich two songs should I pick for representing
Spain, my homeland, but I have decided to select two regional ones.
The first of it is “Ikusi Mendizaleak”. It talks about the place where I was born the 
Basque Country. Almost all people here knows it so I think 
it can be representative for this norther Spain territory. The song talks 
about a group of people that go to the mountains and see beautifull places with 
green grass and a lot of forests. It is a great description of Basque Country wich is 
full of precious, natural places and mountains so worthy to visit. Also it talks about 
how even though you can be tired and the path can be hard you can never give up 
untill you make it to your objective, wich I think is a great and strong message.
The second song I have chosen for representing my homeland is about Seville wich 
is 1000km far away from the Basque Country. I can’t remember the song title but 
here in Spain we all know it. It starts with “Sevilla tiene un color especial” this 
meaning Seville has a special colour. It describes the beautifull places the city has 
and how special these are for their people. Also talks about how the
locals are different from the rest of Spain and how happy and well they live.
To summarise if you ever wanted to go to the north of Spain you should definitely 
listen to the first one and if you wanted to go South to the second, both of them 
are marvelous places to visit and stay!",5,3,3,2,"All content is relevant to the task.

","Music of my homeland: ‘The River’
Did you know that in China traditional music enjoys just as much popularity as 
modern Pop music? As someone who usually listens to the younger generation-radio, 
I could hardly believe the parallel success of the two completely different styles of 
music – until I listened to the traditional song ‘The River’ for the first time.
Unlike the current number one single ‘little red apple’ in the modern charts, which 
is full of positive energy and easy to dance to, ‘The River’ provides a deep insight 
into the Chinese history and its culture. Just by listening to this traditional and 
sentimental song one gets the feeling of being lifted into another space and time, 
when thousands of years ago the Chinese farmers were working hard in the rice 
fields, surrounded by the astonishing sound of massive river waves. If one closes the 
eyes, one can almost see the idyllic nature of giant China, in front of oneself, long 
before the Industrial Revolution and wars.
And if you are not a fan of traditional music, don’t be put off by its title. ‘The 
River’ provides more than simply the description of nature, but it also throws an 
interesting light on the mentality of the Chinese: the strong mind, the persistance, 
the never-ending motivation, that still can be seen today.
In conclusion, ‘little red apple’ is for me a good and popular song in China, which can 
easily cheer you up, representing the positive attitude of the Chinese. But if you 
want to turn away from Westernized music, ‘The River’ is definitely the Chinese 
song that I would recommend to anybody who wants to visit my homeland and to 
learn about the Chinese culture from its earliest stages.",5,4,3,4,"All content is relevant to the task.

Essay,C2,Cambridge,ceq,"Technology in our lives

Despite the obvious advantages of new technology, the speed with which we are confronted with
new developments leaves many feeling overwhelmed. How we respond to new technologies is
often a reflection of how able we are as individuals to cope with change in other areas of our lives.
If we feel in control, we are more likely to embrace innovation; if we are less confident, we may
avoid situations which threaten or challenge us.

Technology at work

Whether it be new software for the office, or state-of-the-art equipment for the factory, the
successful introduction of new technology in the workplace requires effective, practical training in
how to use it. This training allows staff to become familiar with the technology before using it for
real in their daily tasks. Getting everyone on board by preparing them psychologically for change
is the first step, as unless they are persuaded that they, too, will benefit by learning new skills or
doing less interesting tasks more quickly, then whatever form the change takes, it will meet with a
certain amount of resistance.
Write your essay.","MAN VS. COMPUTER:
It is an undeniable truth that technology has become a mainstay in our lives. From our
personal lives to our public sphere tasks, there is a perpetual flow of gadgets and
gizmos creeping into our environments to assist us with our activities. And what’s not
to like? For the most part, even the most monotonous of tasks have become
quicker and easier with the help of these inventions.
Of course, there are those who are not yet completely
comfortable with this notion. The sheer acceleration with which new technologies are
brought to life is enough to make any tradition-oriented person run for
the hills! In fact, it has been proven that an individual’s ability
to ‘cope’ with this phenomenon mirrors their character; people
who hold tighter reins on the happenings in their
lives tend to welcome change, whereas those who are less confident see it as
a threat to a certain degree.
This leads to an impasse in the workplace; an employee probably
cannot avoid working with new technology altogether simply because they are
less confident. Therefore, it is imperative that works are effectively and practically
trained so that they can be in control, and thus have no qualms about
new innovations. The first step here would be to instill the right mindset in employees
by assuring them that they would gain greatly from this change. In fact, this is a
vital step in any effort to seamlessly integrate humans and technology, as it
paves the way for far greater developments in the future.",5,4,3,4,"All content is relevant to the task.

I remember it as if it was yesterday when my English teacher came to me during
a school break and asked me: ‘how would you like to go to Canada for a month
to study at a local high school, all expenses paid?’ As you can imagine, my jaw
dropped something like ten feet at the mere thought of it. I was sixteen at the time
and it seemed like the world was opening in front of me. After I recovered from the
immediate schock I said I would go in a heartbeat, and so we went into the Principle’s
office to call my mother. It wasn’t me making the phonecall but I could perfectly
imagine what my mom’s face was at the other end of the line. Firt of all, she would be
completely puzzled that I was at the Principal’s office because I never got into trouble.
After that, I imagine she was in utter disbelief when she heard the
words: ‘your daughter is going to Canada for a month, if that is okay with you
ofcourse.’ They passed me the phone and my mom asked me: ‘do you want to go?’ to
which I said: ‘YES!’ And that was it, my future had taken a new direction and I was going
to be in Canada by the end of the year.
As I had expected I made a lot of new friends, I fell in love with all the members
of the family that took me in, and I was completely blown away by their completely
different way of life.
It Il is funny though how, despite having had all those wonderful experiences once I
got there, I sometimes find myself thinking about the time I was told that, if I wanted
to, the opportunity was mine, rather than about the time I spent in the actual country.

How about travelling abroad just to find out that the most popular celebration
is the setting of a market? This is exactly what happened to me while I was living in
Ireland.
When I was fourteen I went to the Emerald Country to study. It was autum
when I first arrived and everyone was exited about the big event of the
year: the ploughing market. I must admite that the general excitement dragged
me too. So the big day arrived and my irish family – as I call the family that
hosted me for the year – brought me to the market. Ignorant of me, I had
imagined it as some kind of tradicion, and that there I would find dancers,
singers and all that irish party comitee.
However, things did not go quite as well. Had I not arrived, I started to
smell the cattle “perfume”. There were a lot of people going from one place
to another, chitty-chatting with farmers and admiring the superb cows, but the
dancers and musics were no where to be found. In that situation I tried to make
the most of the day, and it turned up to be a phenomenal experience and a great
anecdote to be telling friends. Looking back at this experience I learned that it does not
matter if at some point things do not live up to your expectations, we must be able
to take advantage of every oportunity that is presented to us. For this reason, I
strongly believe that recalling memorable events in our past can help us grow
as person. We should always try to learn from what we have lived,
although it might be difficult sometimes to face the past, the benefits

A book that brings back endless memories of my childhood is “The Hobbit” by J. R. R
Tolkien. This Story is a prequel of the trilogy “The Lord of The Rings” and narrates the
life of an extraordinary dwarf named Bilbo Baggins.
The reason why this book has a special place in my heart is because of the euphoria
and excitement it brought as I was flipping through the pages as a kid. The
story is based on an adventure that Bilbo Baggins undergoes after being persuaded by an eccentric wizard called Gandalf to join him and other dwarfs. Bilbo’s life takes a quick turn
– from living in a “Hobbit Hole” to battling bizarre creatures and monsters in the woods.
The story had intense moments that as a child left me completely hooked to the plot.
The ultimate goal of the protagonist was to defeat a malevolent
and sinister dragon called “Smaug” and reclaim all of the gold that he stole from the dwarves. Even up to this day, I still consider Bilbo Baggins as one
of the most heroic fictional characters of all time. He was a man living a
normal and ordinary life before he transformed into the benevolent man that made
the most heart-touching and ecstatic memories in this plot.
The impact this book had on me was colossal. I learnt a great deal of values and
ethics from all the characters that made a worthwhile contribution to the story – from learning to remain humble to respecting your kins
and mustering the courage to take up
any challenge, no matter how difficult it may seem. I will also venture in to the
fact that this book, although in classical remains highly relevant for the youth in upcoming generations, not only because of the valuable lessons it has to offer, but because of the mixed feelings of melancholy, merriness, bafflement and adrenaline rushes

Harry Potter is a series of books written by J.K. Rowling, that describes a life of a
child of the same name. However, Harry Potter is a
wizard by birth and as such, he attends a special wizarding school
named Hogwarts.
The first book, is an origin story. It
introduces our main hero, an eleven years old boy, that
he lives with his abusive aunt and uncle, who are muggles – people without the ability
to do magic. During this period, Harry experiences strange occurences, that
are the result of his untapped magical potential. Eventually, Hogwarts’ groundskeeper
named Hagrid delivers a formal school invitation to Harry.
Harry eventually gets to
Hogwarts, where he meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, who
become his best friends.
As the year progresses in Hogwarts, Harry starts to uncover information
about his past and the history of the world of magic. He learns, that not so long
ago, wizards were engaged in a civil war, when dark sorcerer
Voldemort tried to conquer the world.
He also learns that Hogwarts contains an artifact, Philosopher’s Stone, which can
grant eternal life, and that Voldemort, is after it. In the finale,
Harry d and his friends defeat Voldemort using wits
and magic.
I’ve read the book when I was eleven years old, which I consider the perfect age to
pick up the Harry Potter series. It is a whimsical urban fatasy with plotline simple
enough, that the child understands it, but deep enough, so it stays engaged. While there
is a clean definition of who the „bad guys” are, the people occupying Hogwarts are
still fleshed out and nuanced. Also, despite it being part one, it gives its readers a
satisfying ending.

I am writing in response to your monthly topic, this one being “A Good Life”, to
share my view about the quality of life in Dublin, where I live.
Dublin possesses two strong points that makes it stand out as one of the cities
with the best quality of life in Europe: the pace of life and a sense of community.
Firstly, the pace of life in Dublin is considered to be stress-free. Despite the often
foul weather, Dubliners look relaxed and never in a hurry even when going to work.
After work, they would normally share a few pints with colleagues before
heading home, and all these without a scowl on their face. Secondly, there is an
omnipresent sense of community. For example, in my neighbourhood
Smithfield, every Sunday a market and fair is held at Smithfield Square where
families and friends get together to eat or to see the live shows, and
where it is quite normal to share a laugh with a stranger. Tourists often agree
to point out that Dubliners and Irish alike are welcoming, who would come to your
aid when in need.
In my opinion, both a tranquil pace of life and a solid sense of community are
crucial to enhance the quality of life of any town or city. Both have an impact
on the perception of a place, and affect the atmosphere either positively or
negatively. An example of a city with a poor quality of live, which lacks the two
factors above mentioned, would be my birthplace Buenos Aires, Argentina.
People in the streets are constantly stressed due to work, traffic or other issues,
they walk hurriedly and tend to push others out of their way. Additionally, because
of high crime rates, citizens are normally wary of strangers and would never stop
to help others due to paranoia.",5,4,3,3,"All content is relevant to the task.

I have come across your request in one of your magazines and couldn’t help
writing to you as the topic discussed is highly relevant to me.
I’ve been a citizen of a huge metropolis my whole life. As almost everything in
our lives, it has both advantages and disadvantages. I live in the capital of Russia,
Moscow. As far as we all know, the quality of life in any capitals is usually better
than in a province. But what is the cost? I’ve been reconsidering lately whether it is
worth or not to live in a large city.
Urban life seems appealing to the majority of population and consequently a lot of
people tend to move to cities. Therefore, we confront with overpopulation there.

It’s getting more and more complicated, to go out somewhere without being
stuck in endless traffic jams or lines. Of course, there are far more places to visit
and activities to do, and entertaining things to see, but you’ll spend eternity waiting
in line for them. Rush hours are the worst. They affect your mood, productivity and interaction between people. City dwellers tend to be ruthless and extremely impolite.
Although, there is a vast range of opportunities in cities. I myself have got a job
worth doing as wages are higher here. But it was a rather nerve-racking
experience as there were a lot of candidates eager to get it, as well. Now I reckon
I would prefer living in a quiet area and eating healthy natural products than
having untrustable food and drinks imported from an unknown place.
Hope my letter will be in your magazine, it might encourage people to think twice
before moving to cities.
