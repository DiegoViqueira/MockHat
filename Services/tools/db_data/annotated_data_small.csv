  Email Part: I want to provide some food and drink during the films. Is this a good idea?","Good afternoon Mrs Rose
I just got your email and I think it’s really great idea 
becase I think lots of people like watching films.
I personally would prefer Mondays because on Fridays 
I often have other plans with my family
I would really love to see some detective or some 
action films but I relly do’t mind watching something 
different.
I think it’s good idea to have some food or drink 
during the film because lots of people are used to 
it because in cinemas they always eat something so i 
think it would 
be great
Have a nice day",5,5,4,4,"All content is relevant to the task.
The target reader is fully informed about all the points in the task and 
there is a direct and clear response to each one in turn. 
The candidate covers the first point, I think it’s really great idea, and 
clearly says which day they would prefer and explains why. The candidate 
explains which types of films they would like to see, and gives an opinion 
about providing food and drink during the films.
This script therefore obtains a 5 for content as the content points are 
addressed and appropriately developed.","The conventions of an email are used, with opening and closing 
salutations appropriate for the candidate’s context, and there is also a 
reference to the 
input email at the beginning: I just got your email. The register is consistent 
and appropriate.
The email holds the reader’s attention throughout, and communicates 
straightforward ideas in direct response to the input email. Points are 
expressed and explained very clearly","The email is well organised and always coherent, with a clearly 
demarcated short paragraph for each point. 
There is some use of referencing as a cohesive device: lots of people 
are used to it
; so i think it would be great, and the text flows naturally, 
although there is over-reliance on some linking words, such as because
.","A range of everyday vocabulary appropriate for the topic is used: 
detective or some action films
; I personally would prefer
; other plans with 
my family
.
There is a good degree of control of language: but I relly do’t mind 
watching something different; lots of people are used to it; in cinemas they 
always eat something. There are very few errors and none which impede 
communication.
The candidate could improve their language mark by evidencing more use 
of complex grammatical forms, and more variety in sentence structure. "

Clara!",5,2,2,1,"All content is relevant to the task and each point is addressed and 
developed.
The target reader is fully informed in terms of content, and there is 
information to develop the three main content points.","There is an attempt to use the conventions of the communicative task, 
although this is sometimes inappropriate, for example in the closing 
salutations.
The target reader has to make an effort to follow the ideas in places, but 
overall the points and message are communicated: My favorite types of 
the films is comedi and romantic film; Yes is a very good idea, I am buying 
some pop corn … and sweets …","The email is organised overall in that it covers each point in turn, 
sometimes using paragraphing to separate the points. 
The text is connected using basic linking words: because; and; and next. 
However, the organisation of sentences and use of punctuation, relying 
heavily on commas, results in a style more suitable for informal, spoken 
language rather than that of an organised written communication: … 
because I have tennis classes after school, and next. I am going with Laura 
houses, and Friday is perfect. For me, I don’t have nothing, do you like this 
day?","Basic vocabulary is used reasonably appropriately: tennis classes, 
romantic film, sweets.
There is some degree of control of language at times: I have tennis classes 
after school, and next. I am going …; Friday is perfect. For me; do you like 
this day?
However, the numerous errors and lack of control impede meaning at 
times: I’m doesn’t prefer Monday afternoon is doesn’t possible to me; … 
and in the film club was another, and you like, we can see, I don’t have any 
prolem to the film; … or and sweets I don’t know, were you buy in."
