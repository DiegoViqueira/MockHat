Although zoos aim to protect endangered species and educate the public, many argue that keeping animals confined is unethical. In this essay, I will explore both sides and share my opinion.\nFirstly, zoos help prevent extinction. For example, species like pandas, and tigers have been saved through breeding programs.Consequently, zoos play a key role in conservation. However, the living conditions in zoos are often unsuitable. While wild animals roam freely, zoos confine them to small spaces. As a result, animals can suffer stress and health problems. Therefore, zoos cannot replicate natural habitats.\nMoreover, zoos often prioritize profit. For instance, they may focus on visitors instead of animal welfare and they make you understand that sanctuaries are the best place for animal.\nIn conclusion, despite theis conservation efforts, zoos harm animals. We should support alternatives that respect their freedom.",Content,CommunicativeAchievement,Organization,Language,5,5,5,4,0,0,0,0

So, what is a better idea for the learning of the students ? a long summer holiday or more than one but much shorter ?\n\nFirst of all, we have to know that in the countries with multiple holidays they have longer terms, so the students spend more time in class learning, however the countries with a long summer vacation have a large period of time to rest and that helps a lot, although the school year is shorter. But the countries with shorter holidays, having more days of school, they also have more time to learn with a good rythm all the things.\n\nNow we are going to talk about leisure activities in the holidays, because if you have all the holiday time together like in Spain, you can do a large trip in family, or spend more time visiting a relative, in Australia, despite having more holidays they are two weeks long, so you can not stay with a relative or in a place too much time, but you can visit them more times in the year.\n\nFinally we can talk about hobbies, because if you have shorter and more frecuent holidays you can find easer to take an habit of your new hobby, if you have all the holiday time together then you can progress more with that hobby but when you go back to the routine can be difficult to put that activity in you routine.\n\nTo sum up having more and shorter holidays is better for students because they can learn everything with less stress because they have more time, but the best for relax spend time with friends, family or in a trip, the best option is all the vacation time together in one holiday. And depending if you are a more or less productive person you can have less time to find a hobby but more facilities to implement it to your routine, or having a lot of time to find and practice that hobby, but being more difficult to add it to your school schedule.",Content,CommunicativeAchievement,Organisation,Language,5,3,3,3,0,0,0,0

In fact, it has advantages and disadvantages, but in my opinion it brings more advantages.\nOn the one hand, becoming famous could take away some activities such as going to the cinema, going shopping. This is because being known worldwide everyone would stop to ask you for photos or autographs, which can be so stressful.\nOn the other hand, it has some benefits because celebrities usually have a lot of money so they can travel around the world, buy luxuries, have big houses. Therefore, I think they wouldn't have to worry about anything.\nFurthermore, if you are famous, you can get a lot of opportunities wherever you go.

Essay,C1,Cambridge,ceq,An English-language magazine is running a series of articles on the ways our personal identities are shaped by global trends. You decide to send in an article. You should briefly describe one or two ways in which your personal opinions or interests have been shaped by global trends. You should also evaluate the extent to which the influence of global trends on our lives is positive or negative.,"It’s safe to say that our personal identities are often shaped by global trends. From the way we shop to the way we view health, our opinions and behaviours are increasingly influenced by what’s popular online. Nonetheless, is our final decision shaped by the aforementioned opinions, or are we capable of choosing what we want independently of what the current trends deem desirable?\n\n\nA recent conversation with an acquaintance of mine made me come to the realization that I had also, although perhaps unknowingly, allowed emerging opinions on certain matters to influence my behaviour. The conversation took me to an exact moment in my life when, I can now say, I still hadn’t found my true self.\nThis is when I decided I’d take on a zero-carbs diet challenge posed on Instagram. This was not just a diet choice—it was an attempt to align with a broader identity being projected by social media influencers, who presented themselves as embodying health and discipline. Regardless of my educational background in nutrition, the pressure to conform to this particular popular trend clouded my judgement and led me to believe it was a healthy choice. \n\nThe lesson? While these trends can certainly introduce fresh ideas, they also carry the risk of encouraging unhealthy behavior or unnecessary conformity. Therefore, albeit beneficial, it’s essential to balance their influence with a personal sense of authenticity and common sense. \n\nToday, I can confidently say that my stance on global trends is much more indifferent. After all, not everyone shares the same taste, and indulging in a hamburger now and then won’t harm me. Embracing my individuality has brought me peace of mind and a healthier, less toxic environment to live in. Why not join me?\n",Content,Communicative Achievement,Organization,Language,4,4,4,5,0,0,0,0

However, there are some public ones that are believed to be the most used and the less which received help from authorities, so the important topic here is which of all the facilities should recieve more local authorities money?\n\nI have always been into sports, and I have spent my entire life going to sport centres to practice swimming, dancing and other kinds of sports. According to that there has always been a lack of sport material in some sport centres.\nThat is one of the reasons I think they should recieve more money from local authorities, it could increase the amount of material and the one that is very old and needs to be changed, could be replaced by another one newer and in good state.\nNevertheless, I also think that the money should also be invested in faculties inside the sport centre like the clean of restrooms and changerooms.\n\nOtherwise, nature is very important in our lives, specially for people that spends most of their time in cities. I think public gardens are one of the most important areas in cities and they should be cared. Money from local authorities would help to increase and improve the material needed to look after those gardens.\nIt could also help to make an enviromental awareness and to let people see the importance of public gardens and how much the need that money to keep the maintenance.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that local authorities should invest their money in these facilities, because in that way we are not only improving those little places, we are also improving our living quality and in addition, it can make a change in cities, making them look more attracive and secure because of the well resources we count with in public facilities.",Content,CommunicativeAchievement,Organization,Language,4,3,3,3,0,0,0,0

But this places are be there thanks to the help of money from\nthe government and the people who enjoys it. This makes that sometimes, the\nfacility is not in its best state and needs more help. Many people think\nthat the two facilities that need more money from local authorities are public\ngardens and sports centers, but which of these need it more?\n\nIn one hand, public gardens are the green spaces of the cities. All of us need\noxygen to live which is produced by plants! A benefit of giving more money to\nparks or gardens would be that they would make the city cleaner in CO2 and\nit’d serve as a place of reunion for the people of the city. Despite this,\npeople visually don’t see this advantages which could mean that some people will\nnot use the facility, making this money for nothing.\n\nOn the other hand, sports centres are one of the most used facilities. Everyone\nlike the idea of doing sport and healthy. But many people decide not\ngo because they don’t have enough money to pay for it. If this places were\nfree more people would be going there which would led to a healthier\nsociety, biggest importance of this will see that, even when there are\nlots of people, many will not sport if free people don’t do it. All of this could\nmean that the money would not make a big change.\n\nIn conclusion, both of them are good ideas that fail if we think how people\nwill use them. Public gardens are essential for all but people don’t take care\nof them and sports centres are one way of providing people with the\nuse. In my opinion the best option to share would be the public gardens,\nsince you can change the way in what people treat parks to concienciate\nabout their importance while creating a healthier society by teaching cheapest\nways of doing sport.",Content,Communicative Achievement,Organization,Language,4,3,3,2,0,0,0,0

The two more relevant facilities that people are worrying about their development are museums and public gardens. But which of them deserve to receive more money?\n\nOn one hand, museums are places with an enormous cultural importance. Thanks to museums, people can know more about their history and the most relevant things which have an impact in the actual world. However, a lot of people are not really into them so they just find them boring. Also, it really depends on the kind of museum the money is donated to. For example, many people find important to know about natural science but do not feel this way with art or in the other way around.\n\nOn the other hand, public gardens are a very well prepared option. People are now more conscious about climate change and look forward to stop it. Creating public gardens in towns could counteract the pollution produced by cars and industries. In addition, it's a great place for people to spend their free time and disconnect. However, there are also some negative things. A lot of money would have to be invested to maintain the gardens in a good state and not everyone likes to go out.\n\nIn conclusion, museums are a great option because of the culture they proportionate to us but public gardens are more practical and more friendly with the environment.

But if you could choose, which would be the most you would send the money for?\n\nIn one hand you could think about sports centres you can also think that they are very important for people health and entertaimment although a place that most of the people that it recives are sport people all of them have family that will obviosully go and use its services. A negative point about it is that many people pay for going there so it recives money monthly.\n\nIn the other hand we have public gardens that are used by everybody runners, readers families and many more, it makes that place or city look more beautifull and helps to the environment. Unfortunatelly they do not recive as much money as sports centres because people do not pay for going there but it also gets in bad conditions with the big use it recive.\n\nIn conclusion I think that a part of our taxes should go to the public spaces to help them being well conserved and a place to go whenever you want and to do whatever you want whitout needing to pay in that moment.",Content,Communicative Achievement,Organisation,Language,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0
